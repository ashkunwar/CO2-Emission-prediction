# CO2-Emission-prediction
Vehicle CO2 emissions refer to the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of burning fuel in internal combustion engines.These emissions contribute significantly to global warming and climate change, as CO2 is a major greenhouse gas.
This Dataset sourced from kaggle contains data about various vehicle categories and their specifications such as no. of Cylinders, Type of car, Feul consumption metrics etc.

By analysing the metrics in the dataset and conducting co-relation analysis, I selected out most impactful fetures and tested a Linear regression model on the features to find the most effective predictor for CO2 Emissions.
After Scaling the data, The model achieved an accuracy of 87%.
